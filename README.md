# Could be asked Questions🤔

### 🤔Why is it called "Robloxify"?

  > Oh well "Robloxify" means Roblox & Beautify but basically shortened. Roblox, Beautify, 
    Roblox + Beautify = Robloxify, Get it? 

### 🤔Is it a copy of Roblox Galaxy by Freeplay?

  > No & yes, It's not a copy but a modification of the style since I used it yes, but I saw a lot 
    of bugs, and I just wanted to customize to my liking and add things that I like.
